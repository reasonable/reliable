# The Reliable Agentic AI Manifesto

This repository contains a set of principles for building Reliable Agentic AI. It originates in the Summer of 2025 with some of the key practitioners in the field, bridging cutting-edge OSS AI developments with established state-of-the-art distributed systems that power millions of devices already, as well as novel AI-first programming languages, LLM programming approaches, and industrial-strength agentic frameworks.
